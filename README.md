OUR SERVICES

XPros, a solar panel maintenance company specializing in bird proofing critter guard installation and cleaning, started in Central California in 2013. Their excellent service and customer satisfaction led to rapid growth across the entire state. They became a leading provider, even partnering as a subcontractor for major national installers like Tesla Solar (formerly Solar City) and SunRun. Due to high demand, XPros expanded into Southern Nevada and Arizona, hiring more technicians to maintain their quality service and offer cost-effective solutions in areas like Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson. Their ongoing mission is to continue delivering exceptional service to their customers.
